<p>Direct programs are the programs that have been created directly on the control using the Direct Program environment. There are no 3D illustrations available for each step, nor can do any collision checks for these, except machine-against-machine. When a program is picked and open for editing, a screen very similar to the Direct program creation is presented, except that you are now editing a program that was created earlier.</p>

<p>These are the bending programs that have been created either by importing from a 3D model, or by folding up a DXF, or using the profile library. These programs have an accompanying 3D model which can be used to set up back-gauges, or to modify the sequence. When these programs are run, step-by-step 3D illustrations are displayed showing the bending steps that are in progress.</p>

<p>This command allows user to perform operations like converting 3d program to direct program, cloning, exporting and importing files. This command supports the selection multiple programs. You can select or de-select a program by touching it. The options provided by the transfer command include:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>save direct:</strong></p>

<p>This command allows user to make an exact copy of the program(s) selected. Select one or more programs and then press this button to create a copy of the selected program(s). When more than one program is cloned, you get a Clone files dialog which asks whether you want to clone the selected number of files. Once the OK mark is pressed, the files are cloned. Generally, the name of the cloned file will have a number after the part name separated by a hyphen (e.g.in case, you clone a part named P5 then the name of the cloned part will be P5-1. If the name P5-1 already exists, the number will be incremented by one i.e. P5-2).</p>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_forward_backward">Forward / Backward</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using this option, one can set up a sequence by folding up, starting from a flat model. Touch the Forward button, and then touch the bend lines in the flat. As you touch them, the bends are folded up and this becomes the bending sequence. It is also possible to sequence backwards by touching the Backward button. In this case, start with a fully folded model, and indicate the bends in reverse sequence.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_bend_navigator">Bend Navigator</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a 3D model is edited, the Bend Navigator is visible on the top of the screen. This displays the total number of bends in the part, and the bend you are currently working on. For example, this image of the bend navigator shows that there are 4 bends, and we are working on the third bend:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="img/bendnav1.png" alt="bendnav1"></span></p>

<p>Pressing this button will toggle the current bend&#8217;s Skip state. Bends that have been skipped have a small dash in a circle drawn near their bend sequence number in the 3D model. Also, a small x is drawn near the bend number in the bend status window on the top. Tapping this bend will also display Bend Skipped. Note that bends that have been skipped can be sequenced just like any other, so that accurate collision checks can be done with the correct folded/unfolded state of the model.</p>

<p>Use this command to add a pre-bend. Type in the interior angle of the pre-bend to add it. This adds the pre-bend. Then, it must be sequenced using the <strong>forward</strong> or <strong>backward</strong> sequence commands. Then, switch to the tooling page, and do a <strong>recompute</strong> (if recompute is done from the sequence page, the manually computed sequence is over-ridden).</p>

See the below example where we are dragging the punch and aligning it precisely with the die:</p>

<p>Similarly, we can pick up a tool by touching near its left edge or right edge, and that edge can then be used for precise alignment.
You can also touch the part near the bend line and drag it laterally along the machine axis to re-position the part to another tooling station. While dragging tools, you can pick up a part by the left, center or right edge of a bend line, and corresponding snap line displays are drawn to help positioning the part precisely.</p>

<p>The <strong>Length</strong> setting can be used to modify the length of the tool mount; will compute the closest possible length to the one requested based on the tool pieces available in inventory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>Position</strong> setting specifies the position of the tool on the machine. You can specify the left, center or right edge of the tool position by tapping one of the three alignment icons under the Part position input box.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>Part Position</strong> setting positions the currently selected bend line in the workpiece along the machine. For some bends, it is necessary to precisely position the part relative to the tool to avoid flanges from colliding into the punch; this setting allows fine controlling over the part position. Like the tool position, you can specify the part position by the left, center or the right end of the bend line by selecting one of the alignment icons.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>Apply</strong> button is used to apply the changes made to the Length, Position or the Part Position to the model. After you do this, will check for collisions, and if there are any, the Bend Navigator on the top of the screen will glow red, displaying the problems.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clicking this displays the <strong>Assign Setup</strong> dialog (see picture below) that allows you to set the current bend to use a different setup. This dialog displays all the available setups, along with the list of bends that are currently using them. Use this dialog to switch all bends over to a single setup, and then do further adjustments to that setup (like changing some station lengths or re-positioning the part to a different station). After all the editing is done, save the model. At this point, any setups that are not used by any bends are discarded, and the program becomes a "single setup" program.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a new setup is assigned to a bend, it tries to automatically shift the part position along the machine axis until moved under a suitable station. For example, see picture below for a before-and-after view of a setup change. When the setup was changed, the part got shifted to the left so it would correctly engage with the punch and die of the first station on the left.</p>

<p>If no suitable stations are found (for example, all of them are too short, or all of them collide) then the part position is unchanged, and you can drag the part into a new position manually.</p>

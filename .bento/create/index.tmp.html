<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Create page is used to create new press-brake programs. There are four program creation modes available, as seen from the four icons on this page:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>From Profile:</strong> Create a program by drawing a new profile or reusing an existing profile and then extruding the profile to the desired length. The program is then automatically sequenced and tooled-up for bending. Profiles are stored in a list for later reuse.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Fold flat DXF:</strong> Create a program by starting with a flat DXF part (a development), and then fold it to create a 3D model. You can edit the bend lines in the DXF and set bend angles and directions before folding it up. The bends in this model are automatically sequenced and tooled-up for bending. Before folding up the flat pattern, make sure you enter the required parameters in the Settings dialog and verify the thickness and material used. If you plan to use special tools, you should select and lock them in the same dialog. In fact, those parameters influence the dimensions of the resulting folded 3D model. After this initial folding, the 3D model always maintains its dimensions even if you change the tooling using the Edit &gt; Sequence &gt; Recompute.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Import 3D model:</strong> Create a program by starting with a 3D model, an IGES or other common 3D formats (SolidWorks, SolidEdge, STEP, Parasolid etc). The bends in this model are then automatically sequenced and tooled up. When you import a MetaCAM 3D model, that is already tooled and sequenced, you will find that the model is re-tooled while importing it in RightAngle. To keep the tooling intact, you can go to the Edit page and use the import command that transfer provides. Once imported, you can either run or edit the program and then process the model on the brake.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Direct program:</strong> Create a program directly simply by entering back gauge positions, bending angles and bend lengths. The program can be run directly on the brake with a suitable blank.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock warning">

In the first 3 methods, a 3D model of the part you are producing is available (or created) and can display 3D simulations of the bending process. It can also check that the part being bent will not collide with the press-brake or with the tooling. Fouling between different parts of the component during the bending cycle can also be checked.
However, with the Direct Program method, these checks cannot be done since does not have a complete 3D model of the component you are trying to produce. Use this method with care.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All segment lengths are dimensioned; angles which are not 90 degrees are also dimensioned. If a corner uses a large radius (to be done as a step bend), the inner radius is also displayed as a dimension. For example, see the R80 dimension at the top right of the profile above.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_typing_in_new_dimensions">Typing in new dimensions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tap any of the displayed dimensions and type in a new value directly. Then, press Enter to reshape the profile. If length value is entered out of range, an appropriate warning message appears.

<h3 id="_editing_length_dimensions">Editing length dimensions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you tap on a length dimension to edit it, you will notice that a dimension line indicating the exact location the dimension is referred to, is displayed. The dimension arrows also serve another purpose; by tapping on one of the displayed dimension arrows, you can change the dimension from an outer dimension to an inner dimension or vice versa. For example, here is a profile showing a 100 mm outer dimension:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="img/editlength.png" alt="editlength"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upon tapping near the arrow on the right, the dimension leader line is redrawn and the dimension within the input box is updated as well:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="img/editlength1.png" alt="editlength1"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the corner is an acute angled corner, there are three different dimensioning methods, which you can cycle through by tapping on the arrow. The picture below shows all three dimensioning styles in action.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="img/editlength2.png" alt="editlength2"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the second and third style, the dimension reference point is a theoretical sharp point, which does not actually appear on the profile. To assist you in visualizing this point, construction lines are drawn in yellow as seen in the pictures above. Upon cycling through these styles by tapping on the dimension arrow, the actual measurement value also updates.</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="content">
In the profile above, suppose the required distance to the outer corner point is 100 mm. This can be set up by tapping on the arrow until the dimensioning style shows the outer corner point. Now, the value in the input box reads 105.86. Overwrite this by typing in 100; this now sets the outer corner dimension to 100 mm. Now switching to the tangent point dimension, it correspondingly reads 94.14 mm.
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For large-radius bends, you can set the dimension to the outer tangent point, or to the start of the bent section:</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While working with linear dimensions, it is possible to choose between various dimension basis points (on the inner surface, outer surface, the bending section tangent etc). You switch between these by tapping on the dimension line arrow.
Note that just tapping on the arrow does not change the shape of the profile; it just re-dimensions them using a different basis. An appropriate length value can later be typed in to change the profile’s shape.</p>

<h3 id="_editing_a_90_degree_corner">Editing a 90-degree corner</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For 90-degree corners, the angle measurement is not displayed. However, just tapping on the corner displays an edit box with the text 90. Type in a different measurement to change the corner angle. The picture below shows this text box being displayed:</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_editing_the_base_segment_length">Editing the base segment length</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each profile being edited has a base segment; this is the horizontal segment near the center of the profile. The base segment of a profile is special; it acts like the anchor for the profile and you cannot change it to any angle other than horizontal. You can change the base segment’s length by touching one of its endpoints and dragging left or right; the figure below shows the locations where it is possible to touch and drag to change the base segment length for a profile:</p>

<h3 id="_editing_the_length_of_any_other_segment">Editing the length of any other segment</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The length of any other segment can be edited by clicking on the free end of that segment and dragging the same. The free end of any segment is the end that is further away from the base.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="img/editlenseg.png" alt="editlenseg"></span></p>

<p>As the segment is dragged, the length dimension of the segment gets updated continuously, so an immediate feedback on the actual length setting at the segment is achieved.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_changing_a_corner_angle">Changing a corner angle</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To edit a corner angle, click on the free end of a segment and drag it sideways; this changes the angle at the start of the segment. The example below helps us understand how this works. As the segment is dragged to change the angle, the interior angle snaps to some common angles (like 45, 60, 90 and so on). In case of a non-standard angle, drag to set an approximate angle, and then tap on the angle display and type in the exact value.</p>

<li>
<p>The Z1 and Z2 axes are the gauge positions along the machine table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>X axes are gauge distances from the bend line, with increasing X going into the machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The R axis is the vertical positions of the gauges, with positive R going upwards.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the outer height of the flange that needs to be bent is specified, and the gauge position is computed automatically. This computation takes the material, thickness and die opening into account (you can toggle between the two to see the actual Gauge-X that has been computed for a given flange height). On machines where the two gauges can move independently in X, you can input the values for X1 and X2 using the input boxes provided.</p>

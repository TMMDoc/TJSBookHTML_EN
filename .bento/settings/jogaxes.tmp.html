On some press-brakes, the Jog Axes screen can be used to only select the axes to be jogged, and separate Jog Forward and Jog Backward buttons mounted on the operator panel must be pressed to do the actual axis movement. In that case, the jog axes panel will appear a bit different from the one shown in the picture above.

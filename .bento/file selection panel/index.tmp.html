<p>Navigate to another folder by touching on the folder names or drive names on the left. For example, from the view above, if you would like to navigate to c:\RA2012\RAData\FoldDXF, touch the c: drive name. This opens the corresponding drive and lists all the folders within. Then, touch RA2012, then RAData and then FoldDXF. After navigating to the right folder, touch the filename you want to open, and then press the OK mark at the bottom right corner. You can use the pointer shown to the bottom-right corner to scroll down and view other files.</p>

<p>The search, then begins. It searches the sub-directory we are currently in and all the sub-directories. So, you could search an entire hard disk by starting at the root directory. During the search, the title changes to Searching&#8230;&#8203; and a running counter of directories and files are displayed at the bottom. Also, the top right displays a Stop Search button to stop the search.</p>
